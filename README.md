# Programming Club
## What we hope this club can offer for its members:
* Experience working with other programmers as a team (probably most valuable?)
* Fun, chill, social coding (make coding an activity that you can enjoy with others!)
* Ways to illuminate others about technologies and bounce ideas/inspire each other
* Consistent practice, a process to hone your skills
* Become a resource for programmers; it’s always nice to know that a community has your back, and whether we can help people or not, we can always try
  * #1 Consultant for problems, ideas, help with learning, etc…

## What I hope this club can offer for the community:
* One stop shop solution for everything custom software
* Microservices that enhance school/boarding life
* Integration with other clubs that require heavy software side - DEMONs, Big Data(?)

## Goals: 
* Weekly meetings
* Club projects
* Expositions (like Tech Expo but smaller and more frequent), peer review & critiques?
* Summer connection! Programming is something far more than just a class at school or a sports team; I really hope that programming club can bond and become so connected through this lifestyle that we can continue to be active and work on projects over the summer
* Organization! We need some sort of record for our activity, outlines of goals and ideas, perhaps a Github organization too, definitely some sort of tangible “club property” that can continue to be passed down to members and help the club grow through the years

## One idea btw:
* 100x100 pixel logo
* We can supersize our logo and have every club cohead at the end of their senior year write their signature on a pixel 
* Fun tradition imo
* Repeat tradition for logos for every project with team member signatures, and future contributors to the project adding their names
* Now we can record all of our projects through these logos too
* Sorta like r/place type thing?
* Yeah
