								<h3>What we hope this club can offer for its members: </h3>
								<ul>
										<li>Experience working with other programmers as a team (probably most valuable?) </li>
										<li>Fun, chill, social coding (make coding an activity that you can enjoy with others!)</li>
										<li>Ways to illuminate others about technologies and bounce ideas/inspire each other </li>
										<li>Consistent practice, a process to hone your skills </li>
										<li>Become a resource for programmers; it’s always nice to know that a community has your back. Even if the club can't help every programmer with every problem, at least CA programmers will know that there's a programming club that will
												always try.
												<ul>
														<li>#1 Consultant for problems, ideas, help with learning, etc… </li>
												</ul>
										</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>What we hope this club can offer for the community: </h3>
								<ul>
										<li>One stop shop solution for everything custom software </li>
										<li>Microservices that enhance school/boarding life </li>
										<li>Integration with other clubs that require heavy software side - DEMONs, Big Data(?) </li>
								</ul>
						</div>
						<div>
								<h3>Goals: </h3>
								<ul>
										<li>Weekly meetings </li>
										<li>Club projects </li>
										<li>Expositions (like Tech Expo but smaller and more frequent, maybe once a semester?), peer review &amp; critiques? </li>
										<li>Summer connection! Programming is something far more than just a class at school or a sports team; I really hope that programming club can bond and become so connected through this lifestyle that we can continue to be active and work
												on projects over the summer </li>
										<li>Organization! We need some sort of record for our activity, outlines of goals and ideas, perhaps a Github organization too, definitely some sort of tangible “club property” that can continue to be passed down to members and help the
												club grow through the years </li>
										<li>Monthly hackathons! </li>
								</ul>
						</div>
						<div>
								<h3>Tradition: </h3>
								<ul>
										<li>100x100 pixel logo (maybe 8x8 mosaic/tile logo might be better, that would allow people to make new logo after 64 signs) </li>
										<li>We can supersize our logo and have every club cohead at the end of their senior year write their signature on a pixel/tile </li>
										<li>Repeat this logo tradition for every project with team member signatures, and future contributors to the project adding their names </li>
								</ul>
